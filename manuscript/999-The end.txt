Well actually, we've finished the tour! Of course, there's still plenty of 
scope for you to explore Ceylon on your own. You should now know enough to 
start writing Ceylon code for yourself, and start getting to know the 
platform modules.

Alternatively, if you want to keep reading you can browse the 
[reference documentation](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/reference/) or (if you're sitting 
comfortably) read the [specification](http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/current/spec/html_single/index.html).
